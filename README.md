## Configuration File Structure

The item shop is defined by a JSON file containing slots for daily (`daily1` through `daily6`) and featured (`featured1` through `featured4`) items. Each slot includes:

**How To Get ID: To get the CID, etc for an item, go to Fortnite.gg, click on any item, and copy the ID shown at the bottom right of the pop-up. Use that ID to replace "CID_TBD" in your config.**
```json
